    <h1>Chocolate Alfajor</h1>
    <img src="../images/alfajor.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="Italian Mechada Sandwich">
    <p>These chocolate-covered alfajores are a delightful treat, featuring a soft and rich dough made with a blend of flour, cornstarch, and cocoa powder. Sandwiched between the dough is a sweet layer of delicacy (dulce de leche), and the final touch is a smooth coating of melted milk chocolate. The combination of the tender cookies with the creamy filling and the crunchy chocolate shell creates a perfectly balanced and indulgent dessert. These alfajores are a classic favorite, perfect for sharing or enjoying with a cup of coffee.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>For the dough:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>500g sifted flour</li>
        <li>100g sifted cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Gourmet Baking Powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of Gourmet Baking Soda</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of Gourmet Bitter Cocoa Powder</li>
        <li>200g butter at room temperature</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>200g sifted powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the filling:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>500g of delicacy</li>
        <li>400g of Gourmet Milk Chocolate Coverage</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.</li>
        <li>For the dough, mix the flour with the cornstarch, baking powder , baking soda and bitter cocoa powder.</li>
        <li>Place the flour mixture on the table and make a hole in the middle.</li>
        <li>Place the soft butter, eggs and icing sugar in the centre. Work slowly with your fingers, from the centre outwards until a smooth, soft dough forms (this can also be done with a food processor).</li>
        <li>Reserve in a plastic bag or wrap and place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the dough from the refrigerator, sprinkle a little flour on the counter and roll out the dough until it is approximately 1/2 cm thick.</li>
        <li>Using a mould or glass, cut out 5cm circles. Place them on a baking tray lined with baking paper (without butter or oil) and bake for 10 minutes. Allow to cool.</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread the delicacy on one side and cover with the other.</li>
        <li>Melt the Milk Chocolate Coating in a double boiler, stirring constantly to prevent burning. It can also be melted in short intervals in a microwave at medium power.</li>
        <li>Dip each alfajor in melted chocolate and let it rest on parchment paper. Once this process is complete, place it in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the chocolate has hardened the alfajores are ready to serve.</li>
